# Game-Scripts
All scripts are **ONLY** working on PC! 

You can open the .ahk files with any text editor and change the timings or the keys. Don't worry if you've never used AHK before, I've commented on everything so no one should have trouble customizing it. If you're not sure about the name of a key, check out the official [documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/KeyList.htm). If you still run into trouble, let me know. 

## How to use the scripts
1. Download [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and install
2. Download the scripts
3. Double-click the scripts
4. That's it. 

### DAI SEARCH SCRIPT (Dragon Age Inquisition Script)
This script triggers the search every 3 seconds when pressing F8. Pressing it again turns it off again. 
I also highly recommend the Mods [Search Radius Increased](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/1442) and [No Search Pulse Visualization](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/mods/3171) 

### DAO ITEMHIGHTLIGHT SCRIPT (Dragon Age Origins Script) 
This script highlights any interactable item near you for 5 seconds every 5 seconds. 

### AUTOWALK IN EVERY GAME
This script allows you to auto-walk by pressing `NumLock` in every game, whether auto-walk is supported or not.
